======================


" MultiDST - Multiple Testing Made Easy"
The MultiDST Package is a Python library designed for multiple hypothesis testing in statistical analysis. It provides implementations of various methods to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR) in scenarios involving multiple hypothesis tests. Significant Index Plot (SIP) can be used to visualize the significant hypotheses under each of the method with ease.
